~~The old news pages have now been migrated to the new website.~~
~~The old news pages were located at [link removed].~~
~~The new news pages can be found [link removed].~~
The new forums can be found <a href="https://discord.gg/ybWqDAkDES" target="_blank">on Discord.</a>
The wiki is now closed, it will be converted into news articles, or other pages. The forums will be made into a new system, once we have it live. Complex features may be put on to the Github wiki, or other pages.

These closures are due to those pages not being able to be styled to rest of the site, and not being able to use the sites.
