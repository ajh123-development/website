## Intro
Find the source [on git](https://github.com/ajh123-development/HistorySurvival/releases/tag/v0.0.1).

This comes with smooth terrain, which you could wonder around. There is also a useful debug, with your position and camera position, the amount of particles, the region of terrain and the game version.

## Controls
* Use the left control key, with the left or right mouse buttons, to rotate the camera.
* Use the scroll wheel to zoom in or out.
* Use the W, A, S or D keys to move the player.
* Use the R key to return to the world spawn.
* Use the F3 key to open the debug screen.
