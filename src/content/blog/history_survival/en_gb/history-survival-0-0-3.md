## The third version!

This version was first released [on git](https://github.com/ajh123-archives/HistorySurvival/releases/tag/v0.0.3)

This is nearly exactly the same as the second History Survival version. Except the old terrain system has been removed. There is also a new world selection / creation menus. World data is now split into multiple files. Separate game objects are now saved separately along with player data.

The next version 0.0.4 will have better Multiplayer support.

## Controls
* Use the left control key, with the left or right mouse buttons, to rotate the camera.
* Use the scroll wheel to zoom in or out.
* Click the scroll wheel to reset camera angles.
* Use the W, A, S or D keys to move the player.
* Use the R key to return to the world spawn.
* Use the menu bar to open the debug menu.

## Kown Bugs
* Voxel textures are not rendered properly.
