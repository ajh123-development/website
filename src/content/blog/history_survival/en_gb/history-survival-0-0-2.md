## The second version!

This version was first released [on git](https://github.com/ajh123-archives/HistorySurvival/releases/tag/v0.0.2)

This is nearly exactly the same as the first History Survival version. except there is a better GUI system and a brand new Entity component system, which has newer debuging systems. Also worlds are now able to be saved and loaded!

## Controls
* Use the left control key, with the left or right mouse buttons, to rotate the camera.
* Use the scroll wheel to zoom in or out.
* Use the W, A, S or D keys to move the player.
* Use the R key to return to the world spawn.
* Use the F3 key to open the debug screen.(Removed to be reimplemented) Or just use the debug menu...
