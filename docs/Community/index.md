# Community

This is a place where people can publish content for [History Survival](/History_Survival/).

You may upload community pages by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/ajh123-development/website/compare) on GitHub!

If we like your idea we may merge it into the main branch. It may take a few days to appear on the website. We may eventually provide templates which you may use to help with building your page.

By content we curently mean:

* [Mods](/Community/Mods/)
* More to come soon?
