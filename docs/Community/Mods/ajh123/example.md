# Example Mod

This is an example document to show how to upload mods.

You may change the tags to what you want. The steps below are what I recomend.

```yaml

tags:
  - Community           # Recomend
  - Community - Mods    # Recomend
  - Guide               # Recomend: Remove this
  - Game=None           # Recomend: Replace None with History Survival
  - Author=ajh123       # The name of the parent folder which should be the author's name
  - Mod=example         # The mod's id which should also be the name of this file.
  - Version=0.0.1       # The mod's version

```

Also, I would recomend removing the text of this guide in your mod's file.
