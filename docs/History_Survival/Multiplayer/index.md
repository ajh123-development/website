# Multiplayer

History Survival comes with multiplayer.

In order to play ```online-mode``` servers then you must register an account, you may do so [here](/api/auth/register.php).

Once an account is created, you may look at your [profile information](/profile.php). Then you may download a copy of the launcher. This requires atleast Java 8 to be installed. You may be warned that the launcher is unidentified software. The launcher will ask for account details. The username will be your email address used during account creation. Your password will be your password. Did you guess it, Sherlock?

Currrently the launcher isn't downloadable, but please be paitent!
